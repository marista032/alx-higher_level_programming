Task 6 - Write a function that creates an Object from a “JSON file

Task 7 - Write a script that adds all arguments to a Python list, and then save them to a file

Task 12 - Technical interview preparation:

You are not allowed to google anything

Whiteboard first

Create a function def pascal_triangle(n): that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascal’s triangle of n:

Returns an empty list if n <= 0

You can assume n will be always an integer

You are not allowed to import any module

Task 13 - Write a function that inserts a line of text to a file, after each line containing a specific string (see example):

Prototype: def append_after(filename="", search_string="", new_string=""):

You must use the with statement

Task 14 - Write a script that reads stdin line by line and computes metrics:

Input format: <IP Address> - [<date>] "GET /projects/260 HTTP/1.1" <status code> <file size>

Each 10 lines and after a keyboard interruption (CTRL + C), prints those statistics since the beginning:

Total file size: File size: <total size>

where is the sum of all previous (see input format above)

Number of lines by status code:

possible status code: 200, 301, 400, 401, 403, 404, 405 and 500

if a status code doesn’t appear, don’t print anything for this status code

format: <status code>: <number>

status codes should be printed in ascending order

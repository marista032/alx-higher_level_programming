Project 0x02-python-import_modules is all importing, using functions and creating modules in Python. In this project I practiced using the builtin function `dir()` and using command line arguments within Python programs



Task 0: To Import a simple function from a simple file:

Write a program that imports the function def add(a, b): from the file add_0.py and prints the result of the addition 1 + 2 = 3 using print function with string format to display integers by assigning:

*the value 1 to a variable called a; * the value 2 to a variable called b and  * use those two variables as arguments when calling the functions add and print . The result of the program  <a value> + <b value> = <add(a, b) value> followed with a new line

Task 1: To create my first toolbox: Write a program that imports functions from the file calculator_1.py, does some Maths, and prints the result without using the function print (with string format to display integers) more than 4 times and the word calculator_1 should be used only once in my file. The program that imports functions from the file [calculator_1.py](./1-calculator.py) and prints the result of the addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of `10` and `5`. Output: `<a value> <operator> <b value> = <operation(a, b) value>` followed by a new line

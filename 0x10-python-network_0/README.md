Task 6. Find a peak
mandatory
Technical interview preparation:
You are not allowed to google anything
Whiteboard first
Write a function that finds a peak in a list of unsorted integers.
Prototype: def find_peak(list_of_integers):
You are not allowed to import any module
Your algorithm must have the lowest complexity (hint: you donâ€™t need to go through all numbers to find a peak)
6-peak.py must contain the function
6-peak.txt must contain the complexity of your algorithm: O(log(n)), O(n), O(nlog(n)) or O(n2)
Note: there may be more than one peak in the list
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x10$ cat 6-main.py
#!/usr/bin/python3
""" Test function find_peak """
find_peak = __import__('6-peak').find_peak

print(find_peak([1, 2, 4, 6, 3]))
print(find_peak([4, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1]))
print(find_peak([2, 2, 2]))
print(find_peak([]))
print(find_peak([-2, -4, 2, 1]))
print(find_peak([4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1]))

Task 8. cURL a JSON file
#advanced
Write a Bash script that sends a JSON POST request to a URL passed as the first argument, and displays the body of the response.
Your script must send a POST request with the contents of a file, passed with the filename as the second argument of the script, in the body of the request
You have to use curl
Please test your scripts in the sandbox provided, using the web server running on port 5000

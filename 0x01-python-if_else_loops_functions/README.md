Task 0: this program that assigns a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed and prints whether `number` is positive or negative.

  * Prints the number followed by:

    * If the number is greater than 0: `is positive`

    * If the number is 0: `is zero`

    * If the number is less than 0: `is negative`

    * Followed by a new line.



Task 1. This program that assigns a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed and prints its last digit.

  * Prints the string `Last digit of [number] is [last_digit]` followed by:

    * If the number is greater than 5: `and is greater than 5`

    * If the number is 0: `and is 0`

    * If the number is less than 6 and not 0: `and is less than 6 and not 0`

    * Followed by a new line.

  

Task 2. This program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

  * Using only one `print` and one loop.

  * Storing characters in variables or importing modules not allowed.



Task 3. This program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

  * Using only one `print` and one loop.

  * Without storing characters in variables or importing modules.

  * Prints every letter except for `q` and `e`.



Task 4. This program that prints all numbers from `0` to `98` in decimal and hexadecimal.

  * Using only one `print` and one loop.

  * Without storing numbers or strings in variables or importing modules.

  * Printing format: `[decimal] = [hexadecimal]`



Task 5. This program that prints numbers from `0`

  to `99` two digits each.

  * Numbers are separated by `, `, except for the last number, which is followed by a new line.

  * Using no more than two `print` functions and one loop.

  * Without storing numbers or strings in variables or importing modules.



Task 6. This program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits in ascending order.

  * Numbers are separated by `, `, except for the last number, which is followed by a new line.

  * The two digits must be different - `01` and `10` are considered identical.

  * Using no more than three `print` functions and two loops.

  * Without storing numbers or strings in variables or importing modules.



Task 7. islower** `mandatory`

  * The function that checks for lowercase characters.

  * Returns `True` if `c` is lowercase, `False` otherwise.

  * Without importing modules or using `str.upper()` or `str.isupper()`.



Task 8. This function that prints a string in

  uppercase followed by a new line.

  * Using no more than two `print` functions and one loop.

  * Without importing modules or using `str.upper()` or `str.isupper()`.

Task 9. This function that prints the last digit of a number.

  * Returns the value of the last digit.

  * Without importing modules.



Task 10.The function that returns the addition of two integers.

  * Without importing modules.

Task 11. This function that returns `a` to the power of `b`.

  * Without importing modules.



Task 12. This function that prints the numbers from `1` to `100` followed by a space.

  * For multiples of three, `Fizz` is printed instead of the number.

  * For multiples of five, `Buzz` is printed instead of the number.

  * For multiples of three and five, `FizzBuzz` is printed instead of the number.

  * Without importing modules.



Task 13. C function that inserts a number into a sorted linked list.

  * If the function fails, returns `NULL`.

  * Otherwise, returns the address of the new node.

  * Helper files:

    * [linked_lists.c](./linked_lists.c): C functions handling linked lists for testing

    [13-insert_number.c](./13-insert_number.c) (provided by Holberton School).

    * [lists.h](./lists.h): Header file containing definitions and prototypes for all types and functions used in [linked_lists.c](./linked_lists.c) and

    [13-insert_number.c](./13-insert_number.c).



Task 14. This program that prints the alphabet in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase, not followed by a new line.

  * Using only one `print` and one loop.

  * Without storing characters in variables or importing modules.



Task 15.This function that creates a copy of a string without the character at position `n`.

  * Without importing modules.



Task 16. This function matching exactly a

  bytecode provided by Holberton School.

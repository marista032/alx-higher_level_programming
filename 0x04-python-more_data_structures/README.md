ASK 0: Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix. Prototype: def square_matrix_simple(matrix=[]): THE matrix is a 2 dimensional array and Returns a new matrix: Same size as matrix.Each value should be the square of the value of the input



TASK 1: Write a function that replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list. Prototype: def search_replace(my_list, search, replace): and my_list is the initial list; search is the element to replace in the list;  replace is the new element \



TASK 2: Write a function that adds all unique integers in a list (only once for each integer). Prototype: def uniq_add(my_list=[]):

 

TASK 3: Write a function that returns a set of common elements in two sets. Prototype: def common_elements(set_1, set_2):



TASK 4: Write a function that returns a set of all elements present in only one set. Prototype: def only_diff_elements(set_1, set_2):



TASK 5: Write a function that returns the number of keys in a dictionary. Prototype: def number_keys(a_dictionary):



TASK 6: Write a function that prints a dictionary by ordered keys. Prototype: def print_sorted_dictionary(a_dictionary): You can assume that all keys are strings. Keys should be sorted by alphabetic order. Only sort keys of the first level (don’t sort keys of a dictionary inside the main dictionary). Dictionary values can have any type.



TASK 7 Write a function that replaces or adds key/value in a dictionary. Prototype: def update_dictionary(a_dictionary, key, value): key argument will be always a string; value argument will be any type; If a key exists in the dictionary, the value will be replaced; If a key doesn’t exist in the dictionary, it will be created



TASK 8: Write a function that deletes a key in a dictionary. Prototype: def simple_delete(a_dictionary, key=""): ; key argument will be always a string; If a key doesn’t exist, the dictionary won’t change



TASK 9: Write a function that returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2; Prototype: def multiply_by_2(a_dictionary): Assume that all values are only integers; Returns a new dictionary



TASK 10: Write a function that returns a key with the biggest integer value. Prototype: def best_score(a_dictionary): Assume that all values are only integers;If no score is found, return None. Assume all students have a different score



TASK 11: Write a function that returns a list with all values multiplied by a number without using any loops. Prototype: def multiply_list_map(my_list=[], number=0): Returns a new list: Same length as my_list. Each value should be multiplied by number. The Initial list should not be modified, Do not import any module; You have to use map; The file should be max 3 lines



TASK 12: Create a function def roman_to_int(roman_string): that converts a Roman numeral to an integer. Assume the number will be between 1 to 3999. def roman_to_int(roman_string) must return an integer. If the roman_string is not a string or None, return 0



TASK 13: Write a function that returns the weighted average of all integers tuple (<score>, <weight>)Prototype: def weight_average(my_list=[]): Returns 0 if the list is empty



TASK 14: Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix using map ; Prototype: def square_matrix_map(matrix=[]): ; matrix is a 2 dimensional array. Returns a new matrix: Same size as matrix ; Each value should be the square of the value of the input. Initial matrix should not be modified. Do not  import any module, Use map. Do not use for or while. The file should be max 3 lines



TASK15; Write a function that deletes keys with a specific value in a dictionary. Prototype: def complex_delete(a_dictionary, value): If the value doesn’t exist, the dictionary won’t change. All keys having the searched value have to be deleted



TASK 16: Create two C functions that print some basic info about Python lists and Python bytes objects; Create two C functions that print some basic info about Python lists and Python bytes objects
